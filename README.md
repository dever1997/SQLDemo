This repository highlights my expertise in leveraging SQL for data analysis, including but not limited to:

Data Retrieval & Filtering:

Crafting precise SELECT statements to extract relevant data.

Utilizing WHERE clauses with complex conditions (AND, OR, IN, BETWEEN, LIKE) for detailed filtering.

Applying DISTINCT to identify unique values for analytical purposes.

Data Aggregation & Summarization:

Using aggregate functions (COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX()) to summarize data.

Grouping data with GROUP BY and filtering aggregated results with HAVING for analytical segments.

Relational Data Analysis (Joins):

Performing INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL OUTER JOIN operations to combine data from multiple tables, enabling holistic analysis across datasets.

Advanced Analytical Querying:

Subqueries: Employing nested queries for more complex data retrieval and comparison.

Common Table Expressions (CTEs): Structuring complex queries for improved readability and reusability, essential for multi-step analyses.

Window Functions: Leveraging functions like ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), LAG(), LEAD(), NTILE(), and analytical aggregates (SUM() OVER(), AVG() OVER()) for sophisticated trend analysis, ranking, and period-over-period comparisons.

Data Transformation & Manipulation for Analysis:

Utilizing CASE statements for conditional logic and categorizing data.

Applying string manipulation functions (SUBSTRING, LENGTH, CONCAT) and date/time functions (DATE_TRUNC, EXTRACT, DATEDIFF) for feature engineering and time-series analysis.

Handling NULL values (COALESCE, IS NULL) to ensure data integrity for calculations.

Performance Awareness:

Writing efficient SELECT queries to optimize data retrieval from large datasets.
